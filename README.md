# Hi There!!!! 

Hey, my name is Luis Puerto and I live in Zürich since July 2020. I'm from Spain and I've been living and working on different European countries and in the US previously. 

Right now I'm looking for new opportunities where I can apply my skills and background. I'm specially looking for projects related to data analysis / science and with GIS / remote sensing on the Zürich area. 

See you around!
