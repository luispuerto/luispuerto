# Hi there!!!!

My name is Luis Puerto and I live in Zürich since July 2020. I'm from Spain and have previously lived and worked in different European countries and the US. 

My field of expertise lies mainly in sustainability :recycle:, forestry :evergreen_tree:, and spatial explicit analysis :artificial_satellite:, which means that I also work in the data science :telescope: domain since I love to analyze tons of data. The main languages I use when I code are R and Python, but as always, I use others when I need them. 

My formal background is in Forest Engineering / Forestry / Environmental Engineering —depending on the point of view and the needs— but I have worked the last 15 years of my life on spatial explicit analysis. First, using ArcGIS and now, QGIS, GDAL, R, Python, and whatever gets the job done. I love to squeeze data, especially spatial data, to gain valuable insights and produce data visualizations, especially if they are in the form of maps. 

Right now, I'm looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and background in the Zürich area. I look forward to working with you.
